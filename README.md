# Objective <a name="objective"></a>

* The major goal was to implement the functionality to handle all the data needed to create a fully functional social media platform. The API has full CRUD(create,read,update and delete) functionality which lets registered users upload their own posts with the optional ability to include a title, image and content. The posts can be edited or deleted as long as you are the owner. In addition, signed in users can also comment, like or share on posts.

Users can follow other users and they have the ability to update their own profile.

## Flowchart <a name="flow"></a>

 The Flowchart for WeShare was made in Lucidchart.

## Project Management <a name="management"></a>
* Database
        * To create the database schema, I used an graph modelling tool Graph Models which shows the entire relationship between all models in the database.I would like to mention that blocked was not used on this ocassion and I am planning for better structure.
        After following the steps required to install Graph Models, I then used <a href="https://dreampuf.github.io">dreampuf</a> to present the data in a clear way.
